# Santa-Among-Us
Among Us with a Festive Theme!

## Inspiration
In the times of COVID19 when everyone around the world has been forced to stay home during lockdowns - Among Us has been God sent. It has helped milions around the world stay in touch with friends and also make new friends. With Christmas coming, I thought we could have a Christmas themed version of Among Us!

## What it does
The crew is a group of Santas, who are trying to filter out the evil Santas among them. The evil Santas kill Good Santas by giving them gifts which are actually bombs. The flow and play of the original Among Us remain the same. 

## How I built it
Attempts were made to follow tutorials on Unity. Finally ended up using Among Us screenshots and editing them on Photoshop to convey the modified festive version of the Game.

## Challenges I ran into
Despite installing and re-installing Unity, it didn't work. 

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
* Downloading Photoshop and successfully following tutorials to suit my purposes. 
* The idea came in my head and I couldn't let go of it. Had project submissions and assignments due the weekend, so originally was skeptical about making any submission. But sat down for 4 hours in full speed, wrote down the game's story and got fully immersed in it.

## What I learned
* Learnt basic navigation around Adobe Photoshop. 
* I also learnt how to build a story for a game.
